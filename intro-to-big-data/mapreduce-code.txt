MapReduce Code

1. Open a Terminal (Right-click on Desktop or click Terminal icon in the top toolbar). Follow the steps below, copying and pasting or typing the code below to execute a simple word count example.

2. Change Directory to the Hadoop library directory (type):

cd /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/

3. Execute the Hadoop jar command to run the WordCount example (type):

hadoop jar hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar wordcount

4. The wordcount example will output the warning that it needs input and output parameters (you should see this):

Usage: wordcount <in> <out>

5. Let's create a couple of text files with a few words in it for testing, or use a log file (type both commands, one at a time):

echo "Hello world in HDFS" > /home/cloudera/testfile1

echo "Hadoop word count example in HDFS" > /home/cloudera/testfile2

6. Create directory for the input files on the HDFS file system (type):

hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/cloudera/input

7. Copy the files from local filesystem to the HDFS filesystem (type both commands, one at a time):

hdfs dfs -put /home/cloudera/testfile1 /user/cloudera/input

hdfs dfs -put /home/cloudera/testfile2 /user/cloudera/input


Run the Program

8. Run the Hadoop WordCount example with the input and output specified (type):

hadoop jar hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar wordcount /user/cloudera/input /user/cloudera/output

9. Hadoop prints out a large amount of logging information. After completion view the output directory (type):

hdfs dfs -ls /user/cloudera/output

10. Check the output file to see the results (type):

hdfs dfs -cat /user/cloudera/output/part-r-00000

11. Put the output in a location, in this case your cloudera user's home directory, where you can upload it for your submission (type):

hdfs dfs -get /user/cloudera/output/part-r-00000 /home/cloudera/wordcount.txt

After you finish with the last command in the Step 11, you will go on to the 'My Submission' tab where you will be asked to upload the wordcount.txt file which contains the output of running this program.
